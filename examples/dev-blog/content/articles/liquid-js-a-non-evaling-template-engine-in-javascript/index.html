Of late, I’ve needed a robust JavaScript template engine that doesn’t use `eval` (and preferably not `with`). Also, I’ve always liked [Liquid][].

So, two plus two equals... JavaScript! Hah, you thought it was four, didn’t you? Well, that’s what you get for thinking.

Yeah, long story short, I ported Liquid to JavaScript. You can grab it from github (where else?) here: <http://github.com/darthapo/liquid.js>

I’m calling this version 0.1. It’s not battle tested yet, but I know it’ll work using Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, and Adobe Air 1.1.

So what are the differences between running the Ruby version and the JavaScript version? Well, as far as the templates themselves, nothing. It’s a full port, so all of Liquid’s default tags and filters are supported in Liquid.js. I even added a placeholder function that you can implement yourself (based on your own needs) to support the ‘include’ tag.

An easy way to include template in a page is to use script elements, like this:

{{ this.attachment.html_test | sourcecode }}

Currently, Liquid.js requires [MooTools][]. Some of the things I’d like to polish up:

* Remove MooTools requirement, run entirely independent of any other js library
* Add Rhino for console-based testing
* Test, test, test on Internet <strike>Exploder</strike> Explorer
