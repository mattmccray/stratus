  <p>Hello, and welcome to your new stratus site!</p>

Here's some things to keep in mind:

* The homepage is under `pages/home`
* You can create new collections of content via:

      stratus new:collection COLLECTION_NAME

* You can adjust the settings (for feeds, default sorting, and sluglines) in `config/content.yaml`
* You specify the site's title, subtitle, author, url and more in `config/site.yaml`
* If you want to customize the default (boilerplate) content that's created you can modify the templates in `config/defaults/COLLECTION_TYPE.html`
* The `StratusSite` file is actually a Rakefile, so you can add your own tasks there

### Some Helpful Tags/Filters

Liquid is used for the templating system. Stratus comes with a few custom tags and filters to help out.

`sourcecode`
:   Both a tag and filter. If used as a tag, you can specify the language type. If used as a filter and you specify an attachment, it'll put it's contents inline. It's built for use with [CodeHighlighter][].

`uri`
:   Generates a URI for the specified content object or collection.

`url`
:   Generates a full URL (based on the url defined in `config/site.yaml`) for the specified content object or collection.
